What can I do for you or your organization, to share your message with the world?

As a writer I believe, the words written upon the page provide a portal into the life of the writer.

“Whether the words are written with pen and pad or typed on a device”.I learn

“Writing is a journey.” 

There are countless reasons why we write, how we started, and why we continue. Each person has his or her own unique narrative behind the reasons to write.

People like me who born to write always search for something meaningful,a longing to create something of value. Within each writer there exists an artist’s heart and the spirit to share that heart with the world. “It is an intimate relationship that is formed between writer and reader.”

I started my career as a freelancer and  I’ve done everything from books, articles, eBooks, blogs,websites, newspaper and magazine work, SEO content, editing, proofreading and more. 

As a digital marketer I learn, when the reader begins scanning the words of the writer,this opens up the door for endless potential in that newly formed relationship.

As a Content provider,I have developed my writing skills with regards to creative, informative,technical, sales-oriented, and academic writing.

After the learning of 7 years I know what it is like to be in the full flow of progressive thought and inspiration when opening the notebook or blank document to begin writing a new exciting piece I want to give to my readers

My core competencies focus on giving clients a voice in a unique way according to the specialized needs of the project. I love working one-on-one with small businesses, entrepreneurs,start-ups and driven individuals to help them flesh out ideas and bring their brand to a wider audience.

Writing truly became my true love after reading Mitch Albom's ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven.""  

The love I found for reading and writing has grown my passion and allowed me to grow my passion for writing into a career as well.  

To that end, I studied creative writing, American Literature, and British literature in college.  I have a wide range of interests when it comes to writing.  Romance and fantasy are my favorite hands down, but I am happy to write almost anything.

To date, I have ghostwritten an array of erotica, romance, fantasy, fiction, and educational content for others.  I have also written several of my own short stories and novels and begun to self publish in recent years."

Google picks up not only on keywords (SEO) but on unique content. Of course, search engine optimization means little without a compelling reason for consumers to click ""buy it now"" or ""add to cart."" Keywords are not just meant for search engines but to spark emotions within the consumer. Along with a lifestyle flow that can influence a purchase, content is proven to instill a sense of  trustworthiness in buyers. A product with little to no content or content with numerous spelling errors makes an item less appealing and less authentic than a description/title that is well written and upfront.

My passion for writing started way back when I realized that I could shape people's opinions with creative pieces. Yes, I've been around the block for nearly a decade. With no plans to rest on my laurels, I continuously seek innovative ways to stand out in the dynamic writing industry. Today, the craft has taken me from my home turf to the next frontier. 

What works for me? Here's the thing: Given that I prioritize client satisfaction more than anything else, I have made (and continue to make) concerted effort to hone my writing skill. Indeed, a blend of exceptional writing dexterity and a degree in Information Technology has made my work a cut above the rest. 

With respect to my accomplishment, over the years, I have successfully completed a good number of projects. For instance, in early 2018, cryptocurrency was at its ATH (all time high), I wrote over 25 ICO white papers for many different companies from around the world. What's more, I worked as news writer and crypto industry analyst for US-based media houses, Cryptoblockwire.com and Bittpress.com. 

Away from the crypto space, I have also had stints in HRM, Digital Marketing, Upstream Oil and Gas, Occupational Health and Safety (HSE), Computer Networking, etc. While I held these positions in different companies, I would write articles to dissect topics that my mentees struggled with. 

Long story short: Do you need an exceptional wordsmith who will effortlessly key into your (business) goals? If yes, just give me a chance and see what I bring to your project. Sure, you can bank on me to provide you with best-in-class gigs at budget-friendly rates. And without recourse to quality, my turnaround is as fast as the lightning speed.

4.	After the graphics for their project have completely been approved by the client, I start copyediting the copy/story/text and send them a copyedited version of their text to review, change and go over. I supply backup information for my client to review, due to any copyediting choices that I made, that they are unsure about.

Shel-Shok, LLC provides creative, strategic and integrated marketing services for individuals and businesses globally. In a nutshell, we keep clients from continuously banging their heads against the wall by offering solutions to various business and marketing problems. From consulting with clients to ‘help them help themselves’ to full-service writing, graphic design, web design, mobile marketing, social media and marketing consulting to providing networking events and workshops for entrepreneurs… the “Shok Dok” is always in!

Established in 2006

Michelle Sawyers Harris (aka “Shok Dok”), founder and marketing strategist, originally began using the name shel-shok in the early 2000's. The name is a play on words that symbolizes a combination of her nickname and the tendency for her to shock clients after magically producing outstanding work with very little information to start. Since shell shock is a term for a psychological disorder caused by traumatic events, it all too well played right into her interest in medicine. 

The Brainchild

Michelle is a Ph.D. candidate in management/finance (exp 2019) and she earned an MS in marketing/communication, an MA in biology (exp 2018) and a BA in premed/biology. Her education also includes fine arts, advertising, web design, project management, medicine and education. Having worked in private industry and government for 15+ years, she is now devoted full-time to her ""patients"" (Guru clients since 2006). Her childhood dream to become a doctor and earlier career in medicine served as the inspiration for her brand and unique approach. Current research interests include biomimicry and artificial intelligence (AI).

Go Green!

Michelle is a nature-lover and founded Green Matter, an environmental education company. She enjoys teaching science (and cool bugs too!) and encouraging greener living including helping business owners implement eco-friendly ""green"" business practices to help conserve resources."

Poorly thought out, poorly written, poorly edited, and all around BAD fanfiction. However, these stories, terrible as they were, helped me shape my skills into something worthwhile, and every successive story was a little better than the last. I eventually got to the point where I was good enough to help other writers beta read their work, proofread, edit, and even ghost write. Gradually, I found opportunities to turn this into a career, and the rest is history. Fifteen years later, I've written several books and a stage script, ghostwritten several books, and edited for people all over the world.

344,/freelancers/dale-ziemianski," May, 2007", $867 ,"$14,510 ",23 ,78 ," $2,725 ","I combine 3D sculpting with digital painting to create colorful, lifelike illustrations. 

What does this mean to you? Most traditional painting styles require you to look at a line sketch, try to imaging what the final will look like. Then, once the image is painted, if you decide you want to move a tree or a character to another position in the scene, your artist will likely want to charge you more because they'll need to repaint.

Since I use 3D, I can not only re-position a character in the 2D space in your illustration, I can turn them around to face a different direction, or re-pose the character, which a traditional painter would have to re-paint - and charge you more.

I can also digitally alter my illustrations so they appear to be rendered in Oil Paint, Watercolor, Pastels, Pencil or Ink - if you prefer a more traditional looking image."

I have designed everything from wedding invitations, children's book illustrations, blog designs, tattoos (yes several over the years), to book trailers, and online shops.

JennJ Designs is not some big multi-level corporation where your project is handed off to a plethora of minor associates or freelancers who might or might not get back to you within the next 3-7 business days. I personally handle each and every project firsthand and in a very timely manner, mostly getting back to you within 24 hours of your sending an inquiry. I work closely with all of my clients from the word go whether you are needing a simple web ad, a letterhead design, baby shower invite, a book cover, or a complete website or blog design - that you will get a design that not only you will love but at a price that won’t break your bank account! I believe in hard work but I also believe in being fair. That to me means not overcharging my clients with inflated prices and shoddy work that is all to often the norm in the graphic and web design world these days. At JennJ Designs I personally guarantee that you will get quality professional designs that you can be proud of and at a fair price. The job isn't over until you are satisfied!

Wanting to be left alone with her crayons and paints, she explored, through art, what she saw and felt in her world. Against her parents’ dreams of having a travel agent in the family, Abigail studied Visual and Performing Arts at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. She has spent more than twenty years as a graphic designer and, though she enjoys helping people, arranging airline tickets was not the kind of cloud-work that spoke to her. Her clouds took her places unavailable to naysayers.

When her passions began extending into the theater, she found herself directing children’s theater. Working with teen actors helped her to see the pain of being misunderstood and to recognize the need for stories that speak to that pain and give voice to the experience without losing the sense of hope and wonder also present in teen eyes. She began writing short stories for her students. When her son sustained a head injury she decided to tell his story, and so her life as a writer was born along with her debut novel, The Art of Drowning (will be released in the Fall of 2020).

Abigail has earned her Master of Fine Arts degree in Creative Writing. She still designs, directs, and wants to be left alone with her crayons and paints, but Abigail’s clouds have given her a new outlet for her creative soul: writing fiction as a means to reveal the connections between pain and hope, and to give an authentic voice to those unheard.

Abigail lives with her husband, three boys, three birds, and one ferret in Harrisburg Pennsylvania. She also teaches classes, both online and in-person, to the homeschooling community in central Pennsylvania. She also serves as the Special Project Coordinator for a liberal arts college, where she plans and runs a Young Writers Workshop and a Young Filmmakers Workshop."

568,/freelancers/tekmunkey," Jul, 2020", $250 ,$250 ,1 ,1 , $250 ,"In the late 1990s I was an 18 year old geek.  Over a space of 3 years I took a job as a bench tech at a computer store, then upgraded to tech support and server maintenance at an ISP, then went rogue.  I started providing real troubleshooting (not just reinstalling the OS for every little problem), custom software solutions, and pre-purchase support for individuals and small businesses as an on-call provider.  I also worked with outsourcing agencies to become a field agent for Sony Electronics, Hewlett Packard, Cisco Systems, Samsung, and many others.

When I expanded to domain and services hosting, I first registered tekmunkey.com as my personal brand.  Time went by and calling myself ""tekmunkey"" seemed a bit childish, so I went with ""Painter Enterprises"" (Painter being my last name) and I let the tekmunkey domain lapse.  As Painter Enterprises I've worked for city, county, and state governments and I've consulted with interstate and international service providers.

More time went by.  I started freelancing on the internet, with sites including MoonLighter.com (and for awhile Guru too, on another account), RentACoder, Odesk and others, all the while being this big grown-up ""Painter Enterprises.""  Brand recognition with that name is a joke.  I get a lot of offers from support and reseller agencies (and even phone calls seeking services from people) who think I paint things.

In 2018 I went looking for that old tekmunkey brand name again, and ended up having to buy the old domain name at auction.  It's quite distinctive, and everybody can tell at a glance that it's a technical services provider.  It doesn't seem so childish anymore!

I'm tekmunkey on github too, where you can see some esoteric projects I've done including a complete rewrite of UTF8 and 16 for DotNET (written in C#), a lightweight macro or key-reassignment program, and a little framework for writing robust and user-friendly bash terminal scripts with tutorial-grade commentation."

In that time I've written for magazines and newspapers of all kinds, and for Internet publications. I like blogging but my passion is informative article writing. I also do proof-reading and editing from time to time. I enjoy writing product descriptions.  I love research and passing on what I learn to others. Every non-fiction writer is in no small measure a teacher. I often do website content writing because I enjoy lending a hand to other professionals and assisting in their success. 

I love design and I'm also a kitchen and bath designer, with 30 years of experience designing high end-- and not so high end-- kitchens and baths but that doesn't limit my scope. I enjoy writing health, nutrition, and family life topics, home and garden, cooking, as well as, design and home improvement. I write what I'm passionate about. and I believe that when talent meets passion the positive energy comes through in the writing and it excites the reader inspiring them to action.

I've written around a dozen pieces of fanfiction spanning multiple genres, from drama to romance to erotica and more! 

Outside of fanfiction, I've written short stories, stageplays, screenplays, and lots of poetry. Some of these were for school, and some were just for fun! I also once tutored a young man in English to help him earn his GED, so I have a bit of experience in teaching as well. I hope to gain more experience in tutoring/teaching in the future!

I am also a proud member of the LGBTQ community, and it's very important to me that the stories I write involving queer relationships are realistic. I feel that often times, queer relationships in media are played out for shock value or fetishising these relationships, all without giving the characters proper depth.

After retiring from a 20+ year as an engineering consultant, working as a freelance writer was a natural way for me to stay busy. I have always written and enjoy it. Through word of mouth, I successfully completed numerous projects for clients involving things like novels, novellas, marketing brochures, PowerPoint presentations, resumes, website content, blogs, articles, and screenplays. These experiences reinforced my love of writing and I transitioned to it as a full-time, second career in 2011.

Over the years since then, my client base expanded, as did my experience. The larger completed works include dozens of novels (e.g. two cozy mystery series and a western series) and multiple screenplays.

From my Conway, SC home office (just outside of Myrtle Beach), I work seven days a week. With my free time, I read whenever I can and love to cook, brew beer, and woodwork. And sometimes on a rare occasion, I will watch a movie or TV show - just to analyze and learn from the writing of course!


MY BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY:

Client needs are always the top priority and I meet their deadlines, even the tight ones. But making a deadline is meaningless if quality suffers. So, every piece is crafted to be unique and creative.

Each finished narrative is written to move readers with the tone and voice you want.  I often use Skype to talk face to face or use notes and outlines provided by clients to understand their vision, and once a piece is written, comments and revisions are always welcome. I will not rest until you are happy with the end product."

Around age 2, I started making music using pots and pans in the kitchen, and changed the tone by putting soup cans inside them. Later my dad bought me a recorder flute that I quickly learned. In 4th grade I took trumpet lessons with Jim Kurty in Brattleboro.

I went on to become 1st trumpet in the Brattleboro All School Elementary Band within a few months. And I tried out for the B.U.H.S. band in 9th grade and made it in as a 3rd trumpet. While in the B.U.H.S. band, I learned to play many other instruments including trombone, Euphonium, Souzaphone, French Horn, Tubular Bells, Timpani, Bass Drums, Xylophone, Glockenspiel and Cymbals.

After leaving school, I played in the Brattleboro Community Band for a while. Around 1988 or 1989 I got a used piano that was being thrown away, and spent 3 months restoring it myself. I then started teaching myself how to play it and one summer I took some lessons at the Brattleboro Music Center.

You can see a travel blog of mine from Ghana at itsjonesey.wixsite.com/mysite. An earlier version of this (without photos) got over 7000 views on the Conquerclub forum, and stirred up quite a lot of interest on maplewoodonline.

My stage plays tend to be clean, noisy, and interactive. 

My murder evenings usually feature all the guests as suspects, and have more red herrings than a sunburned fish factory. 

My stand - up comedy is clean(ish). 

On the writing site Comedywire I've had over a thousand votes for my material.

My obsessions are Sherlock Holmes, King Arthur, food, and science fiction. I have a smattering (sub-conversational) of various languages. 

As an actor I have mainly appeared on stage, but have been in a few movies, one of which won a number of awards, including ""Outstanding Acting"" and a Judge's ""Best movie"" award at the Scary Cow Festival and ""Best Drama"" at the Superman Appreciation festival. 

I have had little opportunity to indulge in roleplay lately, either tabletop or live-action, but have been involved in that sort of thing since about 1980.

I've attached a couple of episodes of a vlog from 2012, and extracts from a play or two so that you can see some examples of my style of humor. You can see the short movie ""As Seen on TV"" here: vimeo.com/164631885 

Also attached: There's also a Huffington Post article about my play ""Wotcha! Gotcha!"" and a little bit of my roleplay writing.

My novel ""The Dragon's Run"", a much less family-friendly work, is available at Amazon and Barnes and Noble, and you can read an extract online. You can also get my play ""Arrrr!"" there, and read an extract."

764,/freelancers/dimudesigns," Dec, 2011", $85 ,"$6,149 ",5 ,27 ," $3,244 ","Welcome,

I am a Software Engineer with experience in a wide variety of technologies spanning almost a decade.

I started off as a Flash/AS3 developer, where with my computer science background (I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science), I applied OOP concepts and design methodologies (such as Design Patterns) to optimize project work-flow and minimize development time.

Over the last few years I have gradually broadened my skill set, integrating front and back-end tools into my repertoire.

On the client-side I've worked with HTML, CSS, and Javascript extensively, leveraging a number of frameworks and APIs  including JQuery (a javascript library) and Twitter BootStrap. Lately I've been exploring several front-end frameworks (such as Angular, and React.js) and I've settled on mastering Google's Polymer; a truly forward thinking framework that fully leverages the capabilities of modern browsers. 

On the server-side I have developed and maintained CodeIgnitor (a PHP MVC framework) projects, ferrying data to and from MySQL databases at the behest of AJAX requests coming from the front end. Lately, I've been working heavily with Google's Cloud Platform(GCP) crafting and managing NoSQL databases via REST APIs and language specific client APIs, leveraging Cloud Functions (using Node.js) to create custom APIs and integrations with 3rd party applications and using a myriad of tools across GCP to oversee project infrastructure. 

Outside of standard Web Development I am also proficient with Google's GSuite platform (formerly Google Apps) with expertise in App Script and its various service APIs including Google Sheets, Forms, Drive, Calendar, Charts, Gmail etc. In addition, I've developed a Chrome Extension using Google's APIs.

I also dabble in game development with a keen interest in Entity-Component-System architecture.

815,/freelancers/ray-m-foy," Sep, 2019", $54 ,$54 ,2 ,2 , $28 ,"I have pursued creative writing, even with a demanding day job. I took correspondence courses and a couple of “continuing education” classes on short story writing at a nearby college. A local author taught those classes and impressed me in that he was doing the stuff I had been reading about—writing, submitting, and getting published. Inspiration prompted me to give it a try. So I submitted a short story (Supernal) to an online publication and it was accepted. Getting published has never since been that easy (though I later had another story accepted for a printed anthology put out by that same publisher). 

Later, I wrote some well-received short stories for company Christmas celebrations (notably, The Spark). I created a website and a blog, and published my first short novel (A Single Step) on the Smashwords site. I also put out a few of my short works on Smashwords. From there, they percolated out to Barnes and Noble where they received some favorable comments.

All this was enough to keep me going, but I needed to take things to a higher level. I had been working on a post-apocalypse novel since taking a correspondence course on novel-writing. Completing it as a major work became my goal. I had published Print-on-Demand, but no major works of the sort I want my Dentville novels to be. 

If you examine my website (www.rayfoy.com), you’ll find links to my completed works, my personal journal (blog), and info on current projects. My themes are speculative in the spirit of Tolkien and Wells, political in the spirit of Orwell and Huxley, and inspirational in the spirit of Strayed and Coelho. I hope you find something here that appeals to you, and that you’ll spend some time with me on our common journey."
816,/freelancers/michael-allen," Sep, 2003", $53 ,"$19,174 ",17 ,43 ," $4,000 ","With a screenplay recently optioned to producers, I'm one of the top notch writers on Guru. That means that my writing is good enough to make it past the gate and that's what I bring to the table. Access!

In 2000, I was awarded my first book deal by John Gordon Burke Publisher. It was about new urbanism, an interesting way to design cities. That was my first actual taste of writing professionally and I have been enjoying it ever since. 

I have written over twenty books in my career that have led to some rather interesting experiences. I wrote one book for a former NFL player who is now a public speaker. Another interesting book was about discrimination in the workplace at one of the major corporations in America. 

I have also written over ten screenplays that include comedies, dramas, and thrillers. Last year, I wrote a drama about an undercover agent who gets so deep in the gangs of Miami that he has to be yanked out before he ends up in a gang war. It was a true story that led to one of the biggest drug busts in American History. 

After that, a producer asked if I would write a screenplay for her about conversion camps. She gave me the notes and I wrote the screenplay that is now in the hands of executives. 

The screenplay I recently optioned is a thriller that a production company is excited about doing. I retained the rights to write the book and that's what I suggest most people think about when they have a good idea. Write the book and the screenplay. Not only can I help you get your book published, but I can get you in touch with the producers who will want to see your screenplay.

Testimonials:
Producer for my thriller: ""It was a long process, but we’re glad to have found you out of the crowd of 150! Let’s make a film!""

Producer for the conversion camps film: ""The script is extremely great, very well written."""

In my previous full-time work for an educational publisher, my responsibilities included researching and selecting imagery to enhance our texts for both aesthetics and educational value, hiring freelance image researchers and photographers, obtaining rights and permissions, and negotiating fees and vendor contracts to keep on budget.

My editors also relied on my imagination and ease in communication to conduct design meetings, where we would create and manage the appearance of approximately one hundred publications per year.

Earlier in my career I worked as an editorial photographer, and have shot images for stock ever since. I'd like to say that even earlier I was an art student, but really, when does one stop learning from art?

Currently I work with a variety of clients doing image research, permissions and copyright, and digital asset management, in all combinations.  I'm ready to help new clients create their best projects. It's a snap!

Maybe you’re new to the industry, or maybe you’re old-hat. Either way, you’re looking for content that will catch your reader’s attention and then hold it.

Whatever your specific situation is, you’re investing a lot of money and time into your vision. You don’t want to write the content yourself- and it’s pretty tough to hire a writer who knows how to get you more customers.

You don’t want just any writer on the job. You want a professional.


That’s where I come in. Hi, I’m Noemi Contreras.

I’ve made it my business to know everything there is to know about writing content that sells.

From the sales pitch to the content itself, I’ve got you covered. I’ve been in this business for 5 years now and have recently made the switch to writing on the Upwork platform.

Not only am I an expert on content creation, but I have studied in the fields of Psychology, Public Relations, Human Resources, Marketing and Effective Communication.

What does this mean? It means that I understand people. I understand your customers. I know what makes them tick and I know how to keep them coming back for more.

Are you interested yet?


If so, here’s what I want you to do next:

You’re looking for great, affordable content from a professional. The next step is to message me so that we can start the conversation about your project.

Don’t worry- there’s no obligation to hire me. I won’t get pushy! The goal is to find out if we’re a good fit.

If we’re not a good fit, no problem and no hard feelings. However, if we are a good fit, you can look forward to receiving great content at competitive prices- content that will increase your sales and customer base.

Sound good? To get the conversation started, hit the green “Hire Me” button on the top right of this page.

I learned how to walk by leaning on bookshelves; I learned to socialize by talking the ear off of every customer that would let me. (...I also got my first scar by crashing into a book rack. To a two-year-old in a walker, rows of bookcases make excellent racing aisles.)

The publishing industry grabbed me young and never let go. The authors that came in for signings were both friends and heroes. The fact that reading and writing could be a part of your *job* was a revelation.

I wrote my first novel at about age seven. It can't have been more than a few pages, but my mom dutifully helped me type it up and illustrate it (with only the finest clip-art). A romance author who'd visited our store a few weeks earlier had very kindly gifted me an autographed copy of her first young adult book, and I wanted to return the gesture. I printed my story, signed it, and sent it off with pride.

She responded with grace and a hand-written thank-you note, proving she was not just kind, but an actual saint.

I still love to write, but I found as time went on that my favorite part of writing was actually revision—the part at the end of a project when everything is coming together and all you have to do is make it sound pretty. I love words and rhythm and seeing how all the pieces fit together. I also really enjoy collaboration, one of my favorite parts of college writing workshops. There's something so incredibly satisfying about helping someone polish their work until it shines—and there's a lot of joy in it, too."

Interests that grew into passions that grew into unique skills are things like studying social trends, creating original content in video and image format and marketing them to my friends, and image and video editing. I took those skills and continued developing them through school and community projects through the years. Years of being a self-conscious teenager taught me one of my favorite skills yet - photo editing. I've grown from tweaking myself in Photoshop to editing out the unwanted passerby in your travel pics - let me make all of your images flawless.

When I graduated college, I began managing the front desk at a Gettysburg bed & breakfast. It was a small company, which allowed me to wear many hats, including acting as marketing manager and getting my first professional experience with social media management. I also interviewed, hired, and scheduled my full staff of 12 and maintained the company's ghost and history tour guides' schedules during my 2 years there. 

I left the B&B for an opportunity to grow a branch of a staffing company that was just starting out in my town. I managed the branch and it's social media pages. Within months I became interim Director of Social Media for the company and was tasked with leading weekly social media training calls and creating and managing content for over 30 branches nationwide. 

I love social media, design, style, travel, and keeping things organized and I'd love to help you in any way that I can! I never quit and always find a solution to any problem that presents itself.
