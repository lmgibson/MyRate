# MyRate - Trends and data on freelancer hourly rates

You can see the data here: [Freelance Rates](http://157.230.183.143:8501/)

## Welcome

MyRate is a tool to help new freelancers determine how to set their hourly rate. Sites such as Upwork and Guru don't provide guidelines for setting an hourly rate. As a result, new freelancers have to spend time sifting through lists of freelancers to find individuals similar to them in order to determine their hourly rate. MyRate helps freelancers pick their hourly rate by providing them current market information by skillset. The app is currently in development but a draft version is available at the link above.

## How to Use

Generally, the app provides overall market trends in hourly rates among the 180 most successful freelancers such as average hourly rate. Additionally, the app provides detailed hourly rate information by skill.
