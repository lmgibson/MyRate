## Welcome

MyRate is a tool to help new freelancers determine how to set their hourly rate. Sites such as Upwork and Guru don't provide guidelines for setting an hourly rate. As a result, new freelancers have to spend time sifting through lists of freelancers to find individuals similar to them in order to determine their hourly rate. MyRate automates this process to improve the accuracy with which freelancers set their hourly rate (compared to hourly rates in the market) and saves the freelancer time.

## How to Use

The app will be hosted and the link will be provided at that time. Generally, the app will provide overall market trends in hourly rates among the 180 most successful freelancers such as average hourly rate. Additionally, the app will provide detailed hourly rate information by skill, which is searchable so the user can identify other users similar to them.
